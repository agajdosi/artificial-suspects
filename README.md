# **Artificial Suspects**

**Artificial Suspects** is an experimental art game that explores the biases and prejudices of different AI models.  
Rather than analyzing training datasets or statistical outputs, this game allows players to experience AI biases firsthand through gameplay in *Unusual Suspects*.

Play the *Unusual Suspects* board game with AI!  
This standalone game runs on **MacOS, Windows, and Linux**, leveraging **OpenAI** and **Anthropic LLMs**.  
Developed in **Go** and **TypeScript**, using **Wails** for the backend and **Svelte** for the frontend.
